-   Goal of this course is to integrate scientific modeling and statistical modeling.
-   Statistical modeling can be dangerous - models have no wisdom or foresight.
-   Commonly used frequentist tests meant for limited applications. Bespoke statistical models are a better fit for most scientific research.
-   Thinking about causal inference is essential. DAGs are a great way to start.
